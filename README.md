# AlgoMalgo

AlgoMalgo is a simple web service that implements a few algorithms and returns the comptuted results based provided parameters.

The service hosts the following endpoints:

**`GET: /info`**

This will return a list of the available solutions that the service can respond to. An example response is

```json
[
    {
        "title": "FizzBuzz",
        "solution": "fizzbuzz"
    },
    ...
]
```

* `title` is the name of the algorithm

* `solution` is a parameter value that needed for further details on how to use the solution. In this case the `FizzBuzz` solution.

## EndPoints

There are two main endpoints on this service.

* `/info`

* `/solution`

**`GET: /info`**

Is the same as `GET /` and will return a list of available algorithmic solutions and their request params in the `solution` property.

**`GET: /info/:solution`**

`:solution` here is a param value that must match one of the items in the `solution` property from the above returned list
e.g. to get more info about the FizzBuzz algorithm hit `http://<host>:<port>/info/fizzbuzz`. This will provide more details and what parameters or properties the endpoint is expecting.

**`POST: /solution/:solution`**

A request to this endpoint would provide a response based on the input provided. This would expect a payload with certain properties available, this information is available by a call to the corresponding endpoint on the `/info` route as described above.

Any other route would return a `404` status and if a request is made without the expected property or properties a `400` Bad Request is returned with some information.

Any other errors will return a `500` Internal Server Error.

## Setup

To get started, after downloading or checking out the project, run

```bash
npm install
```

from the project root directory, then run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web service on the default port `3000`, you can start it on another port by running:

```bash
PORT=<your port number> npm start
```

## Tests

To run the test suites run

```bash
npm test
```

This will kick of the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test runner and you should see some info in your terminal

## The Algorithms

### `FizzBuzz`

The Fizz Buzz algorithm will take in a number, and return an array of numbers from 0 to the number.

The Palindrome algorithm is expecting a payload with a `word` property

`POST: /solution/palindrome`

```json
{ "word": "race car" }

{ "word": "words to reverse" }
```

It would respond with all the words reversed

### `Binary Search`

The Binary Search algorithm will perform a binary for a given value inside of a list.

The Binary Search algorithm is expecting a payload with a `numArray` and `key` property

`POST: /solution/reverse-words`

```json
{ "numArray": [3,4,7,3,2], "key": 2 }
```

It would return true if the key exists in the list or false otherwise.

### `Bubble Sort`

The Bubble Sort algorithm will perform a bubble sort on an array of numbers from least to greatest.

The Factorial algorithm is expecting a payload with a `num` property

`POST: /solution/factorial`

```json
{ "num": 5 }
```

It would return the calculated factorial value
